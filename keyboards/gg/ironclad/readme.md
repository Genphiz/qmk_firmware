Ironclad

Keyboard Maintainer: Christophe LIN
Based on Redragon Aukey KMG12 and K556 : [Adam Honse](https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1)
Hardware Supported: SN32F248BF

Note : This is a test version. There's still 4 column not lighting up. It seems the D port pins don't support PWM and will need a soft PWM in order to light up the LED. I'm still trying to figure out a way.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make aukey/kmg12:default
